**Spam email definition:** An email which is unsolicited and often times is an advertisement or promotional type email.

**Non spam email definition:** An email that I/the email users should see and not automatically put in a spam folder.
Non spam emails may be often deleted without being read, but we'd rather this happen than the user not see a email that they should have seen.

**Examples:**  
1. Email subject: "[2]2 messages in conversationNew Badge Received" 
Sender "kaggle-noreply@google.com".
    - Classified as non spam
    - Although I don't care much about what badges I've earned, this email is informative about something that happened on my Kaggle account.
      I would rather see it than not.

2. Email subject: "[2]2 messages in conversationReminder: We'll start your next transfer soon." sender "email@transfers.ally.com"
    - Classified as non spam
    - I am already aware this bank transfer happens every month and will likely delete this email without reading.
   However, this is important because it relates to banking, I would want to see this regardless.
3. Email subject: "Spring into Earth Day Savings!" sender: "noreply@marketing.xcelenergy.com"
    - Classified as spam
    - This is promotional content, not something I care to see in my inbox so it is classified as spam.
